## Project Context
Yakutsk faces **extreme subarctic winters** (âˆ’40 Â°C average) and heavy reliance on fossil fuels.  
This design proposes a **localized smart energy grid** to improve efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and integrate **renewable energy** sources.

**Key PCB Features:**
- **Microcontroller-based control** for real-time grid monitoring
- **Relay switching** for load management and fault isolation
- **Sensor integration** for temperature, voltage, and current measurement
- Designed for **robust performance in extreme cold** with industrial-grade components

---

## Sustainability Impact
- Reduces reliance on long-distance fuel transport
- Enables local microgrid operation with renewable inputs
- Improves fault tolerance and recovery during severe weather events

---

## Competition
- Designed for the **Sustainable Energy Association (SEA) Smart Energy Competition**
- Delivered **technical poster** and **pitch presentation** (see [docs/](docs) for materials)
